![](https://raw.github.com/ctznfive/sabbracadabra-theme/master/screenshot.png)



## Introduction ##

Since I couldn't find anything that would satisfy my taste,
I decided to make a custom theme for my daily workflow.
I hope you enjoy this theme.

This theme is being testing with Emacs 24.



## Installation ##


- Download from [on Github](https://github.com/ctznfive/sabbracadabra-theme).

- Place `sabbracadabra-theme.el` in a folder in your Emacs' `custom-theme` load path:

    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")

- It can be applied interactively with

    M-x load-theme RET planet

or by default in your `.emacs` file with

    (load-theme 'sabbracadabra t)
