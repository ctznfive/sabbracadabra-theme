# SabbraCadabra Theme for Emacs #

## Introduction ##

Since I couldn't find anything that would satisfy my taste,
I decided to make a custom theme for my daily workflow.

I hope you enjoy this theme.

This theme is being testing with Emacs 24+.



## Option 1 (medium contrast) ##

## Installation ##


Place `sabbracadabra1-theme.el` and/or `sabbracadabra2-theme.el` in a folder in your Emacs' `custom-theme` load path:

    (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")

It can be applied by default in your `.emacs` file with

    (load-theme 'sabbracadabra1 t)

or

    (load-theme 'sabbracadabra2 t)
